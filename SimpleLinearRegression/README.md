# Simple Linear Regression

### Prediction 
Prediction algorithms generally comes from statistics.  

When prediction is process in the categoric values this implies classification. On the other hand, if it is done in numeric values that implies prediction.
1. Classification
    Categorical
2. Clustering
    Numeric

Prediction generally done in numeric values depend on time interval which means dependent in time intervals. But in some cases, it can be independent.

#### Difference Between Prediction and Forecasting
Prediction is more general. 

Forecasting is used to estimate the future and it is a special part of prediction. It means you have a estimation between some points and you want to predict remainder part is forecasting.

Prediction contains the past values estimations, middle values estimations. For example, there is a missing value in the middle of the dataset, and you want to estimate it. Can be non relation between prediction and time interval. It is used to find the bad data.

### Simple Linear Regression
In this model we have a estimated values and real values. 

y = ax + b

with the above formula, y is a dependent variable, and x is an independent variable. x can be anything. a is a coefficient.

To find a best formula for the model and minimize the error rate.
